I was born and raised in the Bay Area and have spent my entire academic and professional life in various parts of California. I obtained my PhD in 2016 from USC, and have worked in machine learning and architecture roles in the FinTech and HealthTech scene. Currently, I run a machine learning consultancy and assist companies with scaling, automating, and productionizing their workloads. Outside of work, I practice martial arts, make music, and sightsee around San Diego with my family. 


I am excited about the content we will be covering in this course because it is foundational to the algorithms you will be using in your career, whether you are working in "lift and churn" business applications or the next LLM.
